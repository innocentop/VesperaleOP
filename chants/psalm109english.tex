\noindent The Lord’s revelation to my Master:~†~

“Sit on my right:~*~

your foes I will put beneath your feet.”

\noindent The Lord will wield from Zion~†~

your scepter of power:~*~

rule in the midst of all your foes.

\noindent A prince from the day of your birth~†~

on the holy mountains;~*~

from the womb before the dawn I begot you.

\noindent The Lord has sworn an oath he will not change.~†~

“You are a priest for ever,~*~

a priest like Melchizedek of old.”

\noindent The Master standing at your right hand~*~

will shatter kings in the day of his great wrath.

\noindent He shall drink from the stream by the wayside~*~

and therefore he shall lift up his head.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~*~

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~*~

and will be for ever. Amen.
