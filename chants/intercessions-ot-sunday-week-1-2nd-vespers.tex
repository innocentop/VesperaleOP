\lettrine[lines=2]{C}{}hrist the Lord is our head; we are his members. In joy let us call out to him: \Rbar. Lord, may your kingdom come.

Christ our Savior, make your Church a more vivid symbol of the unity of all mankind, – make it more effectively the sacrament of salvation for all peoples. \Rbar.

Through your presence, guide the college of bishops in union with the Pope, – give them the gifts of unity, love and peace. \Rbar.

Bind all Christians more closely to yourself, their divine Head, – lead them to proclaim your kingdom by the witness of their lives. \Rbar.

Grant peace to the world, – let every land flourish in justice and security. \Rbar.

Grant to the dead the glory of resurrection, – and give us a share in their happiness. \Rbar.
