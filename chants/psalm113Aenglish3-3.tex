\noindent When Israel came \uline{forth} from Egypt,~*~

Jacob’s sons from an a\uline{li}en people,

\noindent Judah became \uline{the} Lord’s temple,~*~

Israel be\uline{came} his kingdom.

\noindent The sea fled \uline{at} the sight:~*~

the Jordan turned back \uline{on} its course,

\noindent the mountains \uline{leapt} like rams~*~

and the hills like \uline{year}ling sheep.

\noindent Why was it, sea, \uline{that} you fled,~*~

that you turned back, Jordan, \uline{on} your course?

\noindent Mountains, that you \uline{leapt} like rams,~*~

hills, like \uline{year}ling sheep?

\noindent Tremble, O earth, be\uline{fore} the Lord,~*~

in the presence of the \uline{God} of Jacob,

\noindent who turns the rock in\uline{to} a pool~*~

and flint into a \uline{spring} of water.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~*~

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~*~

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
