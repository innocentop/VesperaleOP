\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{T}{}o Christ the Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, let us pray with joyful hearts: Come, Lord Jesus!
\par \Rbar. Come, Lord Jesus!

Lord Jesus, in the mystery of your incarnation you revealed your glory to the world,
– give us new life by your coming.
\par \Rbar. Come, Lord Jesus!

You have taken our weakness upon yourself,
– grant us your mercy.
\par \Rbar. Come, Lord Jesus!

You redeemed the world from sin by your first coming in humility,
– free us from all guilt when you come again in glory.
\par \Rbar. Come, Lord Jesus!

You live and rule over all,
– in your goodness bring us to our eternal inheritance.
\par \Rbar. Come, Lord Jesus!

You sit at the right hand of the Father,
– gladden the souls of the dead with your light.
\par \Rbar. Come, Lord Jesus!
