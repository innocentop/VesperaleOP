O Christ, upon the mountaintop you let the light of your face shine over Moses and Elijah,

O Christ, you gave light to the world when the glory of the Creator arose over you,
– we pray for men of good will that they may walk in your light.

O Christ, you will reform our lowly body and make it like your glorious one,
– we pray for our brothers and sisters who have died that they may share in your glory for ever.
