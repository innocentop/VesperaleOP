O Christ, you were raised up by the Father and given the name that is above all other names,

\par \Rbar. Lord, through your cross bring us to the glory of your kingdom.

O Christ, at your name every knee in heaven, on earth and under the earth will bend in adoration,
– pour out your love upon all men that they may join together in proclaiming your glory.

O Christ, every tongue shall confess that you are Lord to the glory of God the Father,
– welcome our brothers and sisters who have died into the unfailing joy of your kingdom.
\par \Rbar. Lord, through your cross bring us to the glory of your kingdom.
