\par \Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.

Make us obedient to the teachings of your apostles,
– and bound to the truth of our faith.

As you love the innocent,
– render justice to those who are wronged.

Free those in bondage and give sight to the blind,

Fulfill your promise to those who already sleep in your peace,
– through your Son grant them a blessed resurrection.
\par \Rbar. Lord, hear our prayer.
