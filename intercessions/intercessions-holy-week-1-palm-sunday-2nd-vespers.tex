\lettrine[loversize=0.15,lines=2]{T}{}he Savior of mankind by dying destroyed death and by rising again restored life. Let us humbly ask him: Sanctify your people, redeemed by your blood.
\par \Rbar. Sanctify your people, redeemed by your blood.

Redeemer of the world, give us a greater share of your passion through a deeper spirit of repentance,
– so that we may share the glory of your resurrection.
\par \Rbar. Sanctify your people, redeemed by your blood.

May your Mother, comfort of the afflicted, protect us,
– may we console others as you console us.
\par \Rbar. Sanctify your people, redeemed by your blood.

Look with love on those who suffer because of our indifference,
– come to their aid, and turn our uncaring hearts to works of justice and charity.
\par \Rbar. Sanctify your people, redeemed by your blood.

You humbled yourself by being obedient even to accepting death, death on a cross,
– give all who serve you the gifts of obedience and patient endurance.
\par \Rbar. Sanctify your people, redeemed by your blood.

Transform the bodies of the dead to be like your own in glory,
– and bring us at last into their fellowship.
\par \Rbar. Sanctify your people, redeemed by your blood.
