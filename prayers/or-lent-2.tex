\lettrine[lines=3]{O}{} God, who have commanded us
to listen to your beloved Son,
be pleased, we pray,
to nourish us inwardly by your word,
that, with spiritual sight made pure,
we may rejoice to behold your glory.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you and in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever. \par \Rbar. Amen.
