\lettrine[lines=3]{O}{} God, who through your Word
reconcile the human race to yourself in a wonderful way,
grant, we pray,
that with prompt devotion and eager faith
the Christian people may hasten
toward the solemn celebrations to come.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you and in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
\par \Rbar. Amen.
