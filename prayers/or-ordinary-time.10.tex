\lettrine[lines=3]{O}{} God, from whom all good things come, 
grant that we, who call on you in our need,
may at your prompting discern what is right,
and by your guidance do it.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever. \par \Rbar. Amen.
