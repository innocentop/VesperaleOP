\lettrine[lines=3]{O}{} God, author of every mercy and of all goodness,
who in fasting, prayer and almsgiving
have shown us a remedy for sin,
look graciously on this confession of our lowliness,
that we, who are bowed down by our conscience,
may always be lifted up by your mercy.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you and in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
\par \Rbar. Amen.
