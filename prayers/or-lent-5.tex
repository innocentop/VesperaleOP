\lettrine[lines=3]{B}{}y your help, we beseech you, Lord our God, 
may we walk eagerly in that same charity with which,
out of love for the world,
your Son handed himself over to death.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you and in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
