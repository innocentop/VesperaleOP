I confess to almighty God

and to you, my brothers and sisters,

that I have greatly sinned,

in my thoughts and in my words,

in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,

\vspace{5pt} \emph{And, striking their breast, they say:} \vspace{5pt}

through my fault, through my fault,

through my most grievous fault;

\vspace{5pt} \emph{Then they continue:}\vspace{5pt}

therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,

all the Angels and Saints,

and you, my brothers and sisters,

to pray for me to the Lord our God.

\vspace{5pt} \emph{The absolution by the Priest follows:}\vspace{5pt}

May almighty God have mercy on us,

forgive us our sins,

and bring us to everlasting life.

\Rbar. Amen.
