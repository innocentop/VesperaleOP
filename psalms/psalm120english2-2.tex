from where shall come \uline{my} help?

\noindent My help shall come from \uline{the} Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who made heaven \uline{and} earth.

\noindent May he never allow you \uline{to} stumble!~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Let him sleep not, \uline{your} guard.

\noindent No, he sleeps not \uline{nor} slumbers,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Isra\uline{elâ€™s} guard.

\noindent The Lord is your guard and \uline{your} shade;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

at your right side \uline{he} stands.

\noindent By day the sun shall \uline{not} smite you~$\star$~\nopagebreak

nor the moon in \uline{the} night.

he will guard \uline{your} soul.

\noindent The Lord will guard your going \uline{and} coming~$\star$~\nopagebreak

both now and \uline{for} ever.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
