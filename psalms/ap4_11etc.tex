\noindent O Lord our God, you are worthy ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to receive glory and honor and power.

\noindent For you have created all things; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

by your will they came to be and were made.

\noindent Worthy are you, O Lord, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to receive the scroll and break open its seals.

\noindent For you were slain; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

with your blood you purchased for God

\noindent men of every race and tongue, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

of every people and nation.

\noindent You made of them a kingdom,~†~\nopagebreak

and priests to serve our God, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and they shall reign on the earth.

\noindent Worthy is the Lamb that was slain ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to receive power and riches,

\noindent wisdom and strength, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

honor and glory and praise.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
