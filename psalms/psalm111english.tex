\noindent Happy the man who fears the Lord, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who takes delight in all his commands.

\noindent His sons will be powerful on earth; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the children of the upright are blessed.

\noindent Riches and wealth are in his house; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

his justice stands firm for ever.

\noindent He is a light in the darkness for the upright: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he is generous, merciful and just.

\noindent The good man takes pity and lends, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he conducts his affairs with honor.

\noindent The just man will never waver: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he will be remembered for ever.

\noindent He has no fear of evil news; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

with a firm heart he trusts in the Lord.

\noindent With a steadfast heart he will not fear; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he will see the downfall of his foes.

\noindent Open-handed, he gives to the poor; ~†~\nopagebreak

his justice stands firm for ever. ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

His head will be raised in glory.

\noindent The wicked man sees and is angry, ~†~\nopagebreak

grinds his teeth and fades away; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the desire of the wicked leads to doom.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
