\noindent I have called to you, Lord; hast\uline{en} to help me!~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Hear my voice when I \uline{cry} to you.

\noindent Let my prayer arise before \uline{you} like incense,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the raising of my hands like an eve\uline{ning} oblation.

\noindent Set, O Lord, a guard o\uline{ver} my mouth;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

keep watch at the door \uline{of} my lips!

\noindent Do not turn my heart to things \uline{that} are wrong,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to evil deeds with men \uline{who} are sinners.

\noindent Never allow me to share \uline{in} their feasting.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

If a good man strikes or reproves me \uline{it} is kindness;

\noindent but let the oil of the wicked not a\uline{noint} my head.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Let my prayer be ever a\uline{gainst} their malice.

\noindent Their princes were thrown down by the side \uline{of} the rock:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

then they understood that my \uline{words} were kind.

\noindent As a millstone is shattered to pieces \uline{on} the ground,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

so their bones were strewn at the mouth \uline{of} the grave.

\noindent To you, Lord God, my \uline{eyes} are turned:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in you I take refuge; \uline{spare} my soul!

\noindent From the trap they have laid for me \uline{keep} me safe:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

keep me from the snares of those \uline{who} do evil.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
