who takes delight in all \uline{his} commands.

\noindent His sons will be power\uline{ful} on earth; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the children of the up\uline{right} are blessed.

\noindent Riches and wealth are \uline{in} his house; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

his justice stands \uline{firm} for ever.

\noindent He is a light in the darkness \uline{for} the upright: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he is generous, merci\uline{ful} and just.

\noindent The good man takes pi\uline{ty} and lends, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he conducts his af\uline{fairs} with honor.

\noindent The just man will \uline{nev}er waver: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he will be remem\uline{bered} for ever.

\noindent Open-handed, he gives to the \uline{poor;} ~†~\nopagebreak

his justice stands \uline{firm} for ever. ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

His head will be \uline{raised} in glory.

\noindent The wicked man sees and is \uline{angry,} ~†~\nopagebreak

grinds his teeth and \uline{fades} away; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the desire of the wicked \uline{leads} to doom.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and \uline{to} the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the begin\uline{ning}, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
