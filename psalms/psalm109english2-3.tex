“Sit \uline{on} my right:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

your foes I will put be\uline{neath} your feet.”

your scepter \uline{of} power:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

rule in the midst of \uline{all} your foes.

\noindent A prince from the day of your \uline{birth}~†~\nopagebreak

on the \uline{ho}ly mountains;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from the womb before the dawn \uline{I} begot you.

\noindent The Lord has sworn an oath he will not \uline{change}.~†~\nopagebreak

“You are a priest \uline{for} ever,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

a priest like Melchize\uline{dek} of old.”

\noindent The Master standing at your \uline{right} hand~$\star$~\nopagebreak

will shatter kings in the day of \uline{his} great wrath.

\noindent He shall drink from the stream by \uline{the} wayside~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and therefore he shall lift \uline{up} his head.

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
