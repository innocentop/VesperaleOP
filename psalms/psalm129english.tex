\noindent Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Lord, hear my voice!

\noindent O let your ears be attentive~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to the voice of my pleading.

\noindent If you, O Lord, should mark our guilt,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Lord, who would survive?

\noindent But with you is found forgiveness:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for this we revere you.

\noindent My soul is waiting for the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I count on his word.

\noindent My soul is longing for the Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

more than watchman for daybreak.

\noindent Let the watchman count on daybreak~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and Israel on the Lord.

\noindent Because with the Lord there is mercy~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and fullness of redemption,

\noindent Israel indeed he will redeem~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from all its iniquity.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
