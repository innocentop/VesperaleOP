\noindent I rejoiced when I heard them say: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

“Let us go to God’s house.”

\noindent And now our feet are standing ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

within your gates, O Jerusalem.

\noindent Jerusalem is built as a city ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

strongly compact.

\noindent It is there that the tribes go up, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the tribes of the Lord.

\noindent For Israel’s law it is, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

there to praise the Lord’s name.

\noindent There were set the thrones of judgment ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

of the house of David.

\noindent For the peace of Jerusalem pray: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

“Peace be to your homes!

\noindent May peace reign in your walls, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in your palaces, peace!”

\noindent For love of my brethren and friends ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I say: “Peace upon you.”

\noindent For love of the house of the Lord ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I will ask for your good.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
