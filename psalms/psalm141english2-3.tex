\noindent With all my voice I cry to \uline{the} Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

with all my voice I en\uline{treat} the Lord.

\noindent I pour out my trouble \uline{be}fore him;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I tell him all \uline{my} distress

\noindent while my spirit faints \uline{with}in me.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

But you, O Lord, \uline{know} my path.

\noindent On the way where I \uline{shall} walk~$\star$~\nopagebreak

they have hidden a snare \uline{to} entrap me.

\noindent Look on my right \uline{and} see:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

there is not one who \uline{takes} my part.

\noindent I have no means of \uline{e}scape,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

not one who cares \uline{for} my soul.

\noindent I cry to you, O \uline{Lord.}~†~\nopagebreak

I have said: “You are \uline{my} refuge,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

all I have left in the land \uline{of} the living.”

\noindent Listen then to \uline{my} cry~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for I am in the depths \uline{of} distress.

\noindent Rescue me from those who \uline{pur}sue me~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for they are strong\uline{er} than I.

\noindent Bring my soul out of \uline{this} prison~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and then I shall \uline{praise} your name.

\noindent Around me the just will \uline{as}semble~$\star$~\nopagebreak

because of your good\uline{ness} to me.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
