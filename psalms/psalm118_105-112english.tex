\noindent Your word is a lamp for my steps ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and a light for my path.

\noindent I have sworn and have made up my mind ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to obey your decrees.

\noindent Lord, I am deeply afflicted: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

by your word give me life.

\noindent Accept, Lord, the homage of my lips ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and teach me your decrees.

\noindent Though I carry my life in my hands, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I remember your law.

\noindent Though the wicked try to ensnare me ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I do not stray from your precepts.

\noindent Your will is my heritage for ever, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the joy of my heart.

\noindent I set myself to carry out your will ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in fullness, for ever.



\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
