“Sit on \uline{my} right:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

your foes I will put beneath \uline{your} feet.”

your scepter \uline{of} power:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

rule in the midst of all \uline{your} foes.

\noindent A prince from the day of your \uline{birth}~†~\nopagebreak

on the ho\uline{ly} mountains;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from the womb before the dawn I \uline{be}got you.

\noindent The Lord has sworn an oath he will not \uline{change}.~†~\nopagebreak

“You are a priest \uline{for} ever,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

a priest like Melchizedek \uline{of} old.”

\noindent The Master standing at your \uline{right} hand~$\star$~\nopagebreak

will shatter kings in the day of his \uline{great} wrath.

\noindent He shall drink from the stream by \uline{the} wayside~$\star$~\nopagebreak

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
