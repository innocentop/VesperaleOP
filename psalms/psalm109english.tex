\noindent The Lord’s revelation to my Master:~†~

“Sit on my right:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

your foes I will put beneath your feet.”

\noindent The Lord will wield from Zion~†~

your scepter of power:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

rule in the midst of all your foes.

\noindent A prince from the day of your birth~†~

on the holy mountains;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from the womb before the dawn I begot you.

\noindent The Lord has sworn an oath he will not change.~†~

“You are a priest for ever,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

a priest like Melchizedek of old.”

\noindent The Master standing at your right hand~$\star$~\nopagebreak

will shatter kings in the day of his great wrath.

\noindent He shall drink from the stream by the wayside~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and therefore he shall lift up his head.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
