\noindent Though he was in the form of \uline{God}, ~†~\nopagebreak

Jesus did not deem equality \uline{with} God ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

something to \uline{be} grasped at.

\noindent Rather, he emptied him\uline{self} ~†~\nopagebreak

and took the form of \uline{a} slave, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

being born in the likeness \uline{of} men.

\noindent He was known to be of human \uline{es}tate, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and it was thus that he humbled \uline{him}self,

\noindent obediently accepting ev\uline{en} death, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

death on \uline{a} cross!

\noindent Because \uline{of} this, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

God highly \uline{ex}alted him


\noindent and bestowed on him \uline{the} name ~$\star$~\nopagebreak
above every oth\uline{er} name,

\noindent So that at Je\uline{sus’} name ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

every knee \uline{must} bend

\noindent in the heavens, on \uline{the} earth, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and under \uline{the} earth,

\noindent and every tongue pro\uline{claim} ~†~\nopagebreak

to the glory of God \uline{the] Father: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

JESUS CHRIST \uline{IS} LORD!

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
