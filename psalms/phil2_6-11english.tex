\noindent Though he was in the form of God, ~†~\nopagebreak

Jesus did not deem equality with God ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

something to be grasped at.

\noindent Rather, he emptied himself ~†~\nopagebreak

and took the form of a slave, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

being born in the likeness of men.

\noindent He was known to be of human estate, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and it was thus that he humbled himself,

\noindent obediently accepting even death, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

death on a cross!

\noindent Because of this, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

God highly exalted him


\noindent and bestowed on him the name ~$\star$~\nopagebreak
above every other name,

\noindent So that at Jesus’ name ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

every knee must bend

\noindent in the heavens, on the earth, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and under the earth,

\noindent and every tongue proclaim ~†~\nopagebreak

to the glory of God the Father: ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

JESUS CHRIST IS LORD!

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
