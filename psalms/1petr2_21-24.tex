\noindent Christ suffered for you,~†~\nopagebreak

and left you an example ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to have you follow in his footsteps.

\noindent He did no wrong; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

no deceit was found in his mouth.

\noindent When he was insulted, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he returned no insult.

\noindent When he was made to suffer, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he did not counter with threats.

\noindent Instead he delivered himself up ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to the One who judges justly.

\noindent In his own body ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he brought your sins to the cross,

\noindent so that all of us, dead to sin,~†~\nopagebreak

could live in accord with God’s will. ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

By his wounds you were healed.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
