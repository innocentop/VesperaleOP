\noindent  When I call, answer me, O God of justice;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from anguish you released me, have mercy and hear me!

\noindent O men, how long will your hearts be closed,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

will you love what is futile and seek what is false?

\noindent It is the Lord who grants favors to those whom he loves;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the Lord hears me whenever I call him.

\noindent Fear him; do not sin: ponder on your bed and be still.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Make justice your sacrifice, and trust in the Lord.

\noindent ``What can bring us happiness?" many say.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Let the light of your face shine on us, O Lord.

\noindent You have put into my heart a greater joy~$\star$~\nopagebreak

than they have from abundance of corn and new wine.

\noindent I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
