\noindent My soul, give praise to the Lord;~†~\nopagebreak

I will praise the Lord all my days,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

make music to my God while I live.

\noindent Put no trust in princes,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in mortal men in whom there is no help.

\noindent Take their breath, they return to clay~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and their plans that day come to nothing.

\noindent He is happy who is helped by Jacob’s God,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

whose hope is in the Lord his God,

\noindent who alone made heaven and earth,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the seas and all they contain.

\noindent It is he who keeps faith for ever,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who is just to those who are oppressed.

\noindent It is he who gives bread to the hungry,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the Lord, who sets prisoners free,

\noindent the Lord who gives sight to the blind,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who raises up those who are bowed down,

\noindent the Lord, who protects the stranger~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and upholds the widow and orphan.

\noindent It is the Lord who loves the just~$\star$~\nopagebreak

but thwarts the path of the wicked.

\noindent The Lord will reign for ever,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Zion’s God, from age to age.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
