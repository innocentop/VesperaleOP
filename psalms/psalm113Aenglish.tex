\noindent When Israel came forth from Egypt,~$\star$~

Jacob’s sons from an alien people,

\noindent Judah became the Lord’s temple,~$\star$~

Israel became his kingdom.

\noindent The sea fled at the sight:~$\star$~

the Jordan turned back on its course,

\noindent the mountains leapt like rams~$\star$~

and the hills like yearling sheep.

\noindent Why was it, sea, that you fled,~$\star$~

that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?

\noindent Mountains, that you leapt like rams,~$\star$~

hills, like yearling sheep?

\noindent Tremble, O earth, before the Lord,~$\star$~

in the presence of the God of Jacob,

\noindent who turns the rock into a pool~$\star$~

and flint into a spring of water.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~

and will be for ever. Amen.
