\noindent When Israel came forth from Egypt,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Jacob’s sons from an alien people,

\noindent Judah became the Lord’s temple,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Israel became his kingdom.

\noindent The sea fled at the sight:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the Jordan turned back on its course,

\noindent the mountains leapt like rams~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and the hills like yearling sheep.

\noindent Why was it, sea, that you fled,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?

\noindent Mountains, that you leapt like rams,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

hills, like yearling sheep?

\noindent Tremble, O earth, before the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in the presence of the God of Jacob,

\noindent who turns the rock into a pool~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and flint into a spring of water.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
