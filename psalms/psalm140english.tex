\noindent I have called to you, Lord; hasten to help me!~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Hear my voice when I cry to you.

\noindent Let my prayer arise before you like incense,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the raising of my hands like an evening oblation.

\noindent Set, O Lord, a guard over my mouth;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

keep watch at the door of my lips!

\noindent Do not turn my heart to things that are wrong,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to evil deeds with men who are sinners.

\noindent Never allow me to share in their feasting.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

If a good man strikes or reproves me it is kindness;

\noindent but let the oil of the wicked not anoint my head.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Let my prayer be ever against their malice.

\noindent Their princes were thrown down by the side of the rock:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

then they understood that my words were kind.

\noindent As a millstone is shattered to pieces on the ground,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

so their bones were strewn at the mouth of the grave.

\noindent To you, Lord God, my eyes are turned:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in you I take refuge; spare my soul!

\noindent From the trap they have laid for me keep me safe:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

keep me from the snares of those who do evil.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
