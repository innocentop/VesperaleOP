\noindent In you, O Lord, I take refuge.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Let me never be put to shame.

\noindent In your justice, set me free,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

hear me and speedily rescue me.

\noindent Be a rock of refuge for me,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

a mighty stronghold to save me,

\noindent for you are my rock, my stronghold.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

For your nameâ€™s sake, lead me and guide me.

\noindent Release me from the snares they have hidden~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for you are my refuge, Lord.

\noindent Into your hands I commend my spirit.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

It is you who will redeem me, Lord.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
