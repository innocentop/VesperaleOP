O come, bless the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

all you who serve the Lord,

who stand in the house of the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in the courts of the house of our God.

Lift up your hands to the holy place~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and bless the Lord through the night.

May the Lord bless you from Zion,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he who made both heaven and earth.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
