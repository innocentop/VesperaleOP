\noindent When Israel came forth \uline{from} Egypt,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Jacob’s sons from an ali\uline{en} people,

\noindent Judah became the \uline{Lord’s} temple,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Israel became \uline{his} kingdom.

\noindent The sea fled at \uline{the} sight:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

the Jordan turned back on \uline{its} course,

\noindent the mountains leapt \uline{like} rams~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and the hills like year\uline{ling} sheep.

\noindent Why was it, sea, that \uline{you} fled,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

that you turned back, Jordan, on \uline{your} course?

\noindent Mountains, that you leapt \uline{like} rams,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

hills, like year\uline{ling} sheep?

\noindent Tremble, O earth, before \uline{the} Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in the presence of the God \uline{of} Jacob,

\noindent who turns the rock into \uline{a} pool~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and flint into a spring \uline{of} water.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Ho\uline{ly} Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. \uline{A}men.
