by giving them the lands of the nations.



\noindent His works are justice and truth, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

his precepts are all of them sure,

they are made in uprightness and truth.

\noindent To fear the Lord is the first stage of wisdom;~†~\nopagebreak

all who do so prove themselves wise. ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

His praise shall last for ever!
