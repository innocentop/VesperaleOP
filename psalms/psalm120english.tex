\noindent I lift up my eyes to the mountains:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

from where shall come my help?

\noindent My help shall come from the Lord~$\star$~\nopagebreak

who made heaven and earth.

\noindent May he never allow you to stumble!~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Let him sleep not, your guard.

\noindent No, he sleeps not nor slumbers,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Israelâ€™s guard.

\noindent The Lord is your guard and your shade;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

at your right side he stands.

\noindent By day the sun shall not smite you~$\star$~\nopagebreak

nor the moon in the night.

\noindent The Lord will guard you from evil,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he will guard your soul.

\noindent The Lord will guard your going and coming~$\star$~\nopagebreak

both now and for ever.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
