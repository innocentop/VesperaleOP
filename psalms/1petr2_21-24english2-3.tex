\noindent Christ suffered for \uline{you},~†~\nopagebreak

and left you \uline{an} example ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to have you follow in \uline{his} footsteps.

\noindent He did no \uline{wrong}; ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

no deceit was found \uline{in} his mouth.

\noindent When he was \uline{in}sulted, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he re\uline{turned} no insult.

\noindent When he was made \uline{to} suffer, ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he did not count\uline{er} with threats.

\noindent Instead he delivered him\uline{self} up ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to the One who \uline{judg}es justly.

\noindent In his \uline{own} body ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

he brought your sins \uline{to} the cross,

\noindent so that all of us, dead to \uline{sin},~†~\nopagebreak

could live in accord with \uline{God’s} will. ~$\star$~\nopagebreak

By his wounds \uline{you} were healed.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to \uline{the} Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the \uline{Ho}ly Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, \uline{is} now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ev\uline{er}. Amen.
