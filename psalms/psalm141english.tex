\noindent With all my voice I cry to the Lord,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

with all my voice I entreat the Lord.

\noindent I pour out my trouble before him;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I tell him all my distress

\noindent while my spirit faints within me.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

But you, O Lord, know my path.

\noindent On the way where I shall walk~$\star$~\nopagebreak

they have hidden a snare to entrap me.

\noindent Look on my right and see:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

there is not one who takes my part.

\noindent I have no means of escape,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

not one who cares for my soul.

\noindent I cry to you, O Lord.~†~\nopagebreak

I have said: “You are my refuge,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

all I have left in the land of the living.”

\noindent Listen then to my cry~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for I am in the depths of distress.

\noindent Rescue me from those who pursue me~$\star$~\nopagebreak

for they are stronger than I.

\noindent Bring my soul out of this prison~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and then I shall praise your name.

\noindent Around me the just will assemble~$\star$~\nopagebreak

because of your goodness to me.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
