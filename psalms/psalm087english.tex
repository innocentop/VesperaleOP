\noindent Lord my God, I call for help by day;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I cry at night before you.

\noindent Let my prayer come into your presence.~$\star$~\nopagebreak

O turn your ear to my cry.

\noindent For my soul is filled with evils;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my life is on the brink of the grave.

\noindent I am reckoned as one in the tomb:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I have reached the end of my strength,

\noindent like one alone among the dead;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

like the slain lying in their graves;

\noindent like those you remember no more,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

cut off, as they are, from your hand.

\noindent You have laid me in the depths of the tomb,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in places that are dark, in the depths.

\noindent Your anger weighs down upon me:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I am drowned beneath your waves.

\noindent You have taken away my friends~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and made me hateful in their sight.

\noindent Imprisoned, I cannot escape;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my eyes are sunken with grief.

\noindent I call to you, Lord, all the day long;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

to you I stretch out my hands.

\noindent Will you work your wonders for the dead?~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Will the shades stand and praise you?

\noindent Will your love be told in the grave~$\star$~\nopagebreak

or your faithfulness among the dead?

\noindent Will your wonders be known in the dark~$\star$~\nopagebreak

or your justice in the land of oblivion?

\noindent As for me, Lord, I call to you for help:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

in the morning my prayer comes before you.

\noindent Lord, why do you reject me?~$\star$~\nopagebreak

Why do you hide your face?

\noindent Wretched, close to death from my youth,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

I have borne your trials; I am numb.

\noindent Your fury has swept down upon me;~$\star$~\nopagebreak

your terrors have utterly destroyed me.

\noindent They surround me all the day like a flood,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

they assail me all together.

\noindent Friend and neighbor you have taken away:~$\star$~\nopagebreak

my one companion is darkness.

\noindent Glory to the Father, and to the Son,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and to the Holy Spirit:

\noindent as it was in the beginning, is now,~$\star$~\nopagebreak

and will be for ever. Amen.
